# Traffic Accidents & Weather Analysis - DSA210 Project
## Project Overview
Over the next few weeks, I will analyze traffic accident data from February 2016 to Dec 2021 which covers 49 states of the USA and compare it with historical weather data. The goal is to test the hypothesis that accident rates increase on rainy and snowy days.

Additionally, I will investigate whether accidents are more frequent during nighttime hours. By applying statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, I aim to uncover patterns that provide valuable insights into road safety.

# Objectives
- Understand the Impact of Weather

* Examine how rain and snow influence accident rates.
Analyze Time-Based Accident Trends

+ Determine whether accidents occur more frequently at night.
Data-Driven Insights

- Use statistical methods to validate the hypothesis and identify key factors contributing to accident trends.
Apply Data Science Skills

* Utilize techniques from the DSA210 course to perform real-world data analysis and visualization.
  
# Motivation

1. Road Safety Awareness
Understanding how weather conditions and time of day impact accident rates can contribute to safer driving practices.

2. Scientific Approach
By leveraging data science, I aim to make conclusions based on evidence rather than assumptions.

3. Practical Learning
This project serves as an opportunity to put the theoretical concepts learned in class into practice and  apply data analysis and hypothesis testing techniques to a meaningful real-world scenario.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of U.S. traffic accident records from 2016 to 2021, combined with historical weather data for the same time period.

- **Accident Data Includes:**

Date & Time – When the accident occurred.
Location – The city and state of the accident.
Severity – The level of impact of the accident.
Time of Day – Whether the accident happened during the day or night.
