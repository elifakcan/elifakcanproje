# Traffic Accidents & Crime Rate Analysis - DSA210 Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data from 2023 across 49 states in the USA and compare it with crime rate data from different states. The goal is to test the hypothesis that states with higher crime rates also experience a higher number of traffic accidents.

Additionally, I will investigate whether there are correlations between specific types of crimes and accident frequency. By applying statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, I aim to uncover patterns that provide valuable insights into road safety and urban crime dynamics.

## Objectives

### 1. Understand the Impact of Crime Rates on Traffic Accidents  
- Examine whether states with higher crime rates have a greater number of traffic accidents.
- Identify specific types of crimes that may have a stronger correlation with accident rates.

### 2. Analyze Time-Based and Location-Based Trends  
- Determine if accidents are more frequent in high-crime areas.
- Investigate whether there are patterns based on the time of day or year.

### 3. Data-Driven Insights  
- Use statistical methods to validate the hypothesis and identify key factors contributing to accident trends.
- Identify potential external factors that could influence both crime rates and accidents.

### 4. Apply Data Science Skills  
- Utilize techniques from the DSA210 course to perform real-world data analysis and visualization.

## Motivation

### Road & Public Safety Awareness  
Understanding how crime rates impact accident frequencies can contribute to better urban planning, policy-making, and improved road safety measures.

### Scientific Approach  
By leveraging data science, I aim to make conclusions based on evidence rather than assumptions, ensuring a data-driven perspective on urban safety concerns.

### Practical Learning  
This project serves as an opportunity to put the theoretical concepts learned in class into practice and apply data analysis, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis techniques to a meaningful real-world scenario.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of U.S. traffic accident records from 2023, combined with state-level crime rate data for the same period.

### **Accident Data Includes:**
- **Date & Time** – When the accident occurred.
- **Location** – The city and state of the accident.
- **Severity** – The level of impact of the accident.
- **Time of Day** – Whether the accident happened during the day or night.

### **Crime Rate Data Includes:**
- **State-level crime rates**
- **Types of crimes recorded (violent crimes, property crimes, etc.)**
- **Annual crime trends from 2023**
